						=i/o systems is a technology cooperative comprised of a collected
						team of both talented and seasoned engineers, designers, writers,
						developers, business leaders, entrepreneurs and revolutionaries
						dedicated to the =i/o systems mission statement of developing tech
						with integrity.
					</p>
					<p>
						Technology itself is neutral and apolitical. It is a tool for
						humanity, it is music, it is electricity, it is the telephone, it is
						art, it is science, it is communication, it breeds civilizationâ€™s
						finest achievements and deserves to be celebrated by society, not
						feared, not used merely as a tool to further divide but to solve
						problems, bring people together, push the bounds of innovation and
						to keep our privacy safe and sacred, not to turn it against us.
					</p>
					<p>
						It is our mission to build ethical solutions to problems big and
						small in a collective, collaborative, community effort by utilizing
						carefully researched and thought out strategies that will provide
						fortitude and longevity for our clients as well as within our own
						internal software products.
					</p>
					<p>
						The =i/o systems cooperative includes its own in-house indie gaming
						studio aiming to bring more equality, fun and accessibility to the
						gaming industry with it's future titles.
					</p>
					<p>
						Ultimately, we wish to revolutionize the culture of this industry
						with transparency, science, design, heart and hard work to formulate
						the tools available to humanity to their finest potential for us
						all.
