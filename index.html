						Technology is neutral and apolitical. It is a tool for humanity, it
						is music, it is electricity, it is the telephone, it is art, it is
						science, it is communication, it breeds civilization's finest
						achievements and deserves to be celebrated by society, not feared,
						not used merely as a tool to further divide but to solve problems,
						bring people together, push the bounds of innovation and to keep our
						privacy safe and sacred, not to turn it against us.

						studio, a tech education division, and an R&D wing all focused on
						breaking new ground by improving quality, DEI, accessibility, and
						actual fun with future gaming titles, progressive knowledge sharing

						spearheading what "different" can be. At our core, =i/o is built by
						dreamers, doers, makers, believers, and nurturers. We invite you to
						experience the worlds that we're building. You're welcome here.

						<b>Rose Belmont, Director of Game Development</b>, inspired and
						encouraged by the likes of Dante, Jack Cooper and BT-7274, and of
						course Cloud Strife and that big, big sword, devotes the
						multifaceted qualities of being an exalted prodigy to io's mission
						because improving this industry has been her calling since before
						she can remember. Ever a seeker of knowledge, her studies have
						brought her from depths of the alchemical arts to scripted lines of
						C++, C#, Python, Java and unfortunately, JavaScript.
					</p>
					<p>
						From Unity to Unreal, Blender and 3d texture work, Rose has adapted
						seamlessly along society's gaming industry, tackling languages such
						as G-code and assembly just for kicks. And like any true renaissance
						woman, she's also adept with a sword. Is there nothing she can't do?
					</p>
					<p class="bio">
						<b>Robert Sato, Director of Research & Development and Education</b
						>, is the one responsible for ensuring that all of us never stop
						learning. Precise and meticulous, Robert comes to us after a tenure
						of improving procedure and accessibility protocols in the financial
						sector that thoroughly complement an education path including a BA
						in Economics and copious certifications in software engineering.
					</p>
					<p>
						An obsessive note taker whose organizational values and observant
						nature keep him striving for the highest quality in everything
						around him, be it architecting state-of-the-art coding developments
						or utilizing teaching as a method to learning when sharing
						knowledge.
					</p>
					<p class="bio">
						<b>Kirstin Carnage, Narrative Director</b>, has channeled her
						acerbic wit into so many various forms of writing, marketing, and
						top tier content creation that sometimes even we have trouble
						keeping track of how many corners of the Internet she has frequented
						during her industry tenure that dates back to the early days of
						Twitter. From her work with Can't Talk Media to her charity streams
						for Extra Life, Kirstin's digital versatility goes as far as a
						<a href="https://bit.ly/PeachDefense"
							>feminist essay in defense of Princess Peach</a
						>, and her offline presence is spent speaking out on mental health
						advocacy panels at conventions, writing, and playing all the video
						games she can get her hands on.
					</p>
					<p class="bio">
						<b>Amanda Farough, Creative Director</b>, is a highly collaborative,
						compassionate leader with technical, programming, and production
						skills who can speak across competencies in a variety of settings.
						She's spent much of the last 15 years in and around the game
						industry as a game journalist and critic, business analyst,
						consultant, producer, narrative designer, and writer. Amanda has
						been founding (and running) businesses since 2003 and has no plans
						on stopping. Her business acumen is built on patterns, connection,
						and ocean-deep understanding of how people and process work can (and
						should) work in harmony.
