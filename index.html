					<p>
						=i/o systems is a technology cooperative comprised of a collected
						team of both talented and seasoned engineers, designers, writers,
						developers, business leaders, entrepreneurs and revolutionaries
						dedicated to developing tech with integrity.
					</p>
					<p>
						Technology itself is neutral and apolitical. It is a tool for
						humanity, it is music, it is electricity, it is the telephone, it is
						art, it is science, it is communication, it breeds civilization's
						finest achievements and deserves to be celebrated by society, not
						feared, not used merely as a tool to further divide but to solve
						problems, bring people together, push the bounds of innovation and
						to keep our privacy safe and sacred, not to turn it against us.
					</p>
					<p>
						It is our mission to build ethical solutions to problems big and
						small in a collective, collaborative, community effort by utilizing
						carefully researched and thought out strategies that will provide
						fortitude and longevity for our clients as well as within our own
						internal software products.
					</p>
					<p>
						The =i/o systems cooperative includes an in-house indie gaming
						studio, a tech education division, and an R&D wing all focused on
						breaking new ground by improving equality, fun and accessibility
						with future gaming titles, progressive knowledge sharing
						colloquiums, and raw, authentic experimental media.
					</p>
					<p>
						Ultimately, we're here to revolutionize the culture of this industry
						with transparency, science, design, heart and hard work to formulate
						the tools available to humanity to their finest potential for us
						all.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div id="about-us">
					<p>
						We believe in co-creating a future that's dedicated to bettering
						humanity through technology, not tearing it to pieces through
						disinformation, generative AI, and tech billionaires that miss the
						point altogether. =i/o isn't just doing things differently â€” we're
						spearheading what "different" can be. At our core, =i/o is built by
						dreamers, doers, makers, believers, and nurturers. We invite you to
						experience the worlds that we're building. You're welcome here.

				<p><b>Lilith Teri London, Chief Visionary Officer</b></p>
				<p>
					<b>Rose Belmont, Director of Game Development</b>, inspired and
					encouraged by the likes of Dante, Jack Cooper and BT-7274, and of
					course Cloud Strife and that big, big sword, devotes the multifaceted
					qualities of being an exalted prodigy to io's mission because
					improving this industry has been her calling since before she can
					remember. Ever a seeker of knowledge, her studies have brought her
					from depths of the alchemical arts to scripted lines of C++, C#,
					Python, Java and unfortunately, JavaScript.
				</p>

				<p />
				<p>
					From Unity to Unreal, Blender and 3d texture work, Rose has adapted
					seamlessly along society's gaming industry, tackling languages such as
					G-code and assembly just for kicks. And like any true renaissance
					woman, she's also adept with a sword. Is there nothing she can't do?
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Robert Sato, Director of Research & Development and Education</b>,
					is the one responsible for ensuring that all of us never stop
					learning. Precise and meticulous, Robert comes to us after a tenure of
					improving procedure and accessibility protocols in the financial
					sector that thoroughly complement an education path including a BA in
					Economics and copious certifications in software engineering.
				</p>

				<p />
				<p>
					An obsessive note taker whose organizational values and observant
					nature keep him striving for the highest quality in everything around
					him, be it architecting state-of-the-art coding developments or
					utilizing teaching as a method to learning when sharing knowledge.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Kirstin Camil, Narrative Director</b>, has channeled her acerbic
					wit into so many various forms of writing, marketing, and top tier
					content creation that sometimes even we have trouble keeping track of
					how many corners of the Internet she has frequented during her
					industry tenure that dates back to the early days of Twitter. From her
					work with Can't Talk Media to her charity streams for Extra Life,
					Kirstin's digital versatility goes as far as a feminist essay in
					defense of Princess Peach, and her offline presence is spent speaking
					out on mental health advocacy panels at conventions, writing, and
					playing all the video games she can get her hands on.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Amanda Farough, Creative Director</b>, is a highly collaborative,
					compassionate leader with technical, programming, and production
					skills who can speak across competencies in a variety of settings.
					She's spent much of the last 15 years in and around the game industry
					as a game journalist and critic, business analyst, consultant,
					producer, narrative designer, and writer. Amanda has been founding
					(and running) businesses since 2003 and has no plans on stopping. Her
					business acumen is built on patterns, connection, and ocean-deep
					understanding of how people and process work can (and should) work in
					harmony.
