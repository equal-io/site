						at =i/o we see technology as neutral and apolitical. It is a tool for humanity, it is music, it is electricity, it is the telephone, it is art, it is science, it is communication, it breeds civilization's finest achievements and deserves to be celebrated by society, not feared, not used merely as a tool to further divide but to solve problems, bring people together, push the bounds of innovation and to keep our privacy safe and sacred, not to turn it against us.
					</p>

				<div id="mission">
					<div id="info-header"><h1>what is =i/o?</h1></div>
					<p class="info txt-left">
						=i/o systems is a California based worker owned and operated tech cooperative with members of equal ownership scattered remotely across the US. =i/o was formed under the general principles of wanting to work for ourselves, with people we trusted, and to redefine the way a business could be run in much the same way we set out to redefine how we thought the tech industry could be run, with a holistic community oriented focus that centers people.
					</p>
					<p class="info txt-left">
						The =i/o systems cooperative includes an in-house indie gaming
						studio, a tech education division, and an R&D wing all focused on
						breaking new ground by improving quality, DEI, accessibility, and
						actual fun with groundbreaking software, future gaming titles, entirely new models for digital interaction and raw, authentic experimental media.
					</p>
					<div id="mission-header"><h1>our mission</h1></div>
					<p class="info txt-right">
						It is our mission to craft ethical solutions for the varying problems that exist across the entire spectrum of the technology industry. Collective, collaborative, community efforts utilizing carefully researched and thought out strategies will provide fortitude and longevity to all of our work.
					</p>
					<p class="info txt-right">
						Ultimately, we're here to democratize the entire culture of this industry with transparency, science, design, heart and innovative hard work to put tech where it belongs: back in the hands of the people.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div id="about-us">
					<div id="about-header"><h1>about us</h1></div>
						<p class="info txt-left">
						We are pioneers, unafraid to challenge the status quo when we recognize that it does not exist to best serve the people. We see the world as deserving of the best and most holistic that tech can be, and we aim to be the scientists who are unafraid to push boundaries in the proper ways to ensure this can be and the teachers who will pass on this knowledge to whoever seeks to gain it.
					</p>
					<p class="info txt-left">
						We believe in co-creating a future that's dedicated to bettering
						humanity through technology, not tearing it to pieces through
						disinformation, generative AI, and tech billionaires that miss the
						point altogether. =i/o isn't just doing things differently â€” we're
						spearheading what "different" can be.
					</p>
					<p class="info txt-left">
						At our core, =i/o is built by
						dreamers, doers, makers, believers, and nurturers. We invite you to
						experience the worlds that we're building. You're welcome here.

						<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/londondata/">Lilith Teri London, Chief Visionary Officer</a>, loves to quip, "I was born on the internet." She spent her
						life immersed in innovative technologies, from formative memories of
						first-generation Nintendo and Prodigy ISP alongside her father, to
						eventually helping run influential underground pre-Myspace era
						social networking blogs as a teenager. She was pioneering digital
						culture long before influencers came upon the scene.</p>
						<p class="bio2"> Lilith became a
						self-made tech entrepreneur by 23 with her first tech company, a
						social media/digital marketing agency, and followed that with a

						tenure <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/instructors/teri-london/25608">teaching</a>, mentoring, and spearheading advanced educational
						methods before moving on to pursue her life's work: forming =i/o.</p>
						<p class="bio2">A
						champion for ethical good, Lilith compiled the =i/o team for one
						simple purpose: to make a difference in the tech world. She grew up
						alongside pivotal change and upheaval; the role technology has
						played in her life influenced her to dedicate her studies, time, and
						talent towards ensuring that technology's role in society remain
						dedicated to societal evolution, solving problems, and taking care
						of people -- be it in social media, software, video games, or
						experimental tech.</p>

						because improving this industry has been her calling since before
						she can remember. Ever a seeker of knowledge, her studies have
						brought her from depths of the alchemical arts to scripted lines of

					</p>
					<p class="bio2">
						From Unity to Unreal, Blender and 3d texture work, Rose has adapted
						seamlessly along society's gaming industry, tackling languages such
						as G-code and assembly just for kicks. And like any true renaissance
						woman, she's also adept with a sword. Is there nothing she can't do?

						Twitter. From her work with Can't Talk Media to her charity streams
						for Extra Life, Kirstin's digital versatility goes as far as a
